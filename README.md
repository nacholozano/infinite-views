Web clone of [Google Material Tabs](https://material.io/guidelines/components/tabs.html). <br>
Made in VanillaJS with requestAnimationFrame and CSS 2D transforms. <br>
Built with ionic2 in mind. So better test in mobile. <br>
Thinking of make more native app's behavior with web technologies. Specific for ionic2.
